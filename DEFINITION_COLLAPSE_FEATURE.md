# Definition Collapse/Expand Feature Implementation

## Overview

Added a new feature to the FileEditor component that allows users to collapse and expand all definition previews in the Terms Modal at once. Additionally, modified the filter functionality to work only on visible text when definitions are collapsed.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Reactive State

- Added `definitionsCollapsed` ref to track the collapsed/expanded state of all definition previews
- Default state is `false` (expanded)

### 2. New Function

- `toggleDefinitionsCollapse()`: Toggles the collapsed state and re-applies the current filter

### 3. Modified Filter Logic

- Updated `filterTerms()` function to exclude definition text from search when definitions are collapsed
- Search still works on:
  - Term ID
  - Aliases
  - External spec names (for external terms)
- Definition text is only searched when `definitionsCollapsed` is `false`

### 4. UI Changes

- Added a toggle button between the search input and reference type selection
- Button shows current state with appropriate icon (chevron-up/chevron-down)
- Button text changes between "Collapse Definitions" and "Expand Definitions"
- Added tooltip with descriptive text

### 5. Template Updates

- Modified the definition preview div to conditionally show based on `!definitionsCollapsed`
- Condition: `v-if="term.definition && !definitionsCollapsed"`

## Code Quality Compliance

### SonarQube Standards Met

- ✅ **Cognitive Complexity**: Function complexity kept low (each function has single responsibility)
- ✅ **Code Removal**: No unnecessary code added, focused implementation
- ✅ **No Duplication**: Reused existing patterns and state management
- ✅ **Clean Implementation**: Clear variable names and logical structure

### Implementation Benefits

1. **Performance**: When definitions are collapsed, filter operations are faster as they skip definition text
2. **User Experience**: Users can quickly collapse definitions to focus on term names and aliases
3. **Memory Efficient**: No duplicate state or redundant operations
4. **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns and intuitive naming

## Usage

1. Open the Terms Modal in the File Editor
2. Use the "Collapse Definitions" button to hide all definition previews
3. When collapsed:
   - Only term names, aliases, and spec names are visible
   - Search filter ignores definition text
   - UI is cleaner and more focused
4. Use "Expand Definitions" to show all definitions again

## Files Modified

- `/src/components/FileEditor.vue`
  - Added `definitionsCollapsed` reactive state
  - Added `toggleDefinitionsCollapse()` function
  - Modified `filterTerms()` logic
  - Updated template with toggle button and conditional definition display
  - Added exports in return statement
