## How to authenticate

Use a  Personal Access Token (PAT). This token is tied to your GitHub user account. That is why you do not have to enter a username. You can delete the token at any time and create a new one.

## Spec-Up-T structure

### Collection of files

- Collection of files
- “Multiple Word documents”
- Written in **markdown** language.

### File structure

How is Spec-Up(-T) organised:

#### Files and folders (for completeness)

If you use ***Spec-Up-T Web Editor*** you'll never see this anyway:

```
/
├─ .env.example
├─ .git
├─ .github
├─ .gitignore
├─ .npmrc
├─ assets
├─ docs    <========================
├─ node_modules
├─ package-lock.json
├─ package.json
├─ README.md
├─ spec    <========================
├─ specs.json    <==================
└─ static
```

#### Relevant for you

| ❶ `spec` folder | ❷ `specs.json` file | ❸ `docs` folder |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Input | Computer Instructions | Output |
| Files with markdown text | How you want it | Web page |
| Where you are writing | Where you do your settings | What people read |

`spec`: markdown files containing specification text and terms and definitions
`specs.json`: configuration file with instructions on how to do it,
`docs`: `index.html` containing the processed markdown files, stitched together in one file
