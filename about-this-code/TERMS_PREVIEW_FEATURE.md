# Terms Preview Feature

## Overview

The Terms Preview feature provides a simple, static view of all terms and definitions in a repository without any editing capabilities or complex interactions. It scans multiple sources for term definitions, including traditional terms directories and external specifications, giving users a comprehensive overview of all terminology used in the specification.

## Location

The "Terms Preview" button is located in the main navigation bar, visible only when viewing a repository (when repository context is available).

## Features

### Multiple Term Sources
- **Terms Directory**: Traditional `spec/terms-definitions` folder structure
- **External Specifications**: Terms referenced from other specifications

### Two View Modes
1. **Compact View**: Shows terms in a list format with truncated definitions
2. **Detailed View**: Shows terms in card format with full definitions and metadata

### Search and Filtering

- **Search**: Find terms by name, aliases, definition content, or source location
- **Filter by Source**:
  - All Terms
  - Local Terms (Terms Dir) - from traditional terms directory
  - External Terms - from other specifications

### Term Information Displayed

- **Term Name**: The primary identifier for the term
- **Aliases**: Alternative names for the same term
- **Definition**: The full definition content (supports HTML rendering)
- **Source Badge**: Visual indicator showing term origin:
  - üóÇÔ∏è **Terms**: From traditional terms directory (blue)
  -  **External**: From external specifications (green)
- **File Location**: Shows which file contains the term definition

## Implementation Details

### Modal Behavior
