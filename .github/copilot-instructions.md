- This code will be referred to as “Spec-Up-T Editor”, or ”editor”
- All code will have to pass SonarQube analysis
- Always choose native browser API's over another NPM package
- Cognitive complexity should be kept ideally below 15
- Remove code if possible, instead of adding code
- Avoid duplication whenever possible, but keeping cognitive complexity low has priority
- If you create files, explain why they are not deleted, why they should stay, and how to use them
- Do not mention the gulp instruction since it does not apply to this repo
- Oftentimes `specification` means `repo` meanse `index.html`
