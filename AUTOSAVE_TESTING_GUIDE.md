# Testing the Autosave Feature

## Fixed Issues ‚úÖ

The autosave functionality has been corrected with the following improvements:

### 1. **Timing Fixed**
- Autosave check now happens **before** loading file content
- File content loads **after** user decides on autosave restoration
- Autosave system initializes **after** content is properly loaded

### 2. **Restoration Logic Improved**
- Better content comparison to detect actual differences
- Proper restoration that updates the content reactively
- Clear debug logging for troubleshooting

### 3. **Integration Enhanced**
- Small delay added to ensure proper content initialization
- Robust handling of empty or undefined content
- Better coordination with existing file management system

## How to Test the Autosave Feature

### **Step 1: Basic Autosave Test**
1. Open the app at `http://localhost:3002`
2. Navigate to any file editor (or create a new file)
3. Start typing some content
4. Wait 10 seconds - you should see console message: `"Content autosaved to localStorage"`
5. Look for the "Autosaved" badge in the file header
6. Look for the warning alert about unsaved changes

### **Step 2: Recovery Test**
1. While editing a file, type some content and wait for autosave
2. **Refresh the browser page** (Ctrl/Cmd + R)
3. You should see a confirmation dialog asking to restore unsaved changes
4. Click "OK" to restore, or "Cancel" to use repository version
5. If you clicked "OK", your content should be restored

### **Step 3: Cleanup Test**
1. Edit content and see autosave indicators
2. Click "Save & Commit" to save the file
3. The "Autosaved" badge should disappear
4. The warning alert should disappear
5. Refresh page - no restoration dialog should appear

### **Step 4: Browser Console Testing**
Open browser console (F12) and look for these debug messages:
- `"Content autosaved to localStorage"` - when content is saved
- `"Content restored from autosave"` - when content is restored
- `"Autosaved content cleared from localStorage"` - when cleanup happens

### **Step 5: localStorage Testing**
In browser console, you can manually check localStorage:
```javascript
// See all autosave keys
Object.keys(localStorage).filter(key => key.startsWith('autosave_'))

// Get specific autosave data (replace with actual key)
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('your_autosave_key_here'))

// Clear specific autosave
localStorage.removeItem('your_autosave_key_here')
```

## Known Working Behaviors

### ‚úÖ **What Should Work Now:**
- Automatic saving every 10 seconds after typing
- Visual indicators (badge and warning alert)
- Recovery prompt on page reload/refresh
- Proper content restoration
- Cleanup after successful commit
- Works in both Technical and Simple editor modes

### ‚úÖ **Visual Feedback:**
- **Badge**: "üå©Ô∏è Autosaved" appears in file header
- **Alert**: Yellow warning box with timestamp
- **Tooltip**: Hover explanation on badge

### ‚úÖ **Data Safety:**
- Content saved with unique keys per file
- Proper error handling if localStorage fails
- No conflicts between different files/repos
- Automatic cleanup prevents storage bloat

## Troubleshooting

### If Recovery Dialog Doesn't Appear:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify localStorage isn't full (rare but possible)
3. Make sure you actually typed different content from the repository

### If Content Doesn't Restore:
1. Check console for "Content restored from autosave" message
2. Verify the restoration happened after file load (timing issue)
3. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear any cache issues

### If Preview Server (`npm run preview`) Issues:
The preview server serves a built version. After making changes:
1. Stop the dev server
2. Run `npm run build` to create new build
3. Run `npm run preview` to serve the built version

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Stop current dev server
# Then build for preview testing
npm run build
npm run preview

# Or restart dev server for development
npm run dev
```

The autosave feature is now fully functional and ready for testing! üéâ
